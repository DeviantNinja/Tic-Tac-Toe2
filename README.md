Well My Programs done i think, I really should test it more thouroughly maybe once i get to unit testing i can come back and try to find out how resiliant it is. 

for now though I am going to move onto my next project i dont know what that is yet, another simple game i expect. 

I have alot to learn, but i tried, failed, failed better. I have no doubt there is a much more elegent solution to doing this and i will likely come back a and redo it in a few months once i've learned some more. 

I think for version 2 i would like to clean up the code, and maybe try adding a graphical interface.
